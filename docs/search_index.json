The rticles package provides a suite of custom R Markdown LaTeX formats and templates for various formats, including Elsevier journal template. Under the hood, LaTeX templates are used to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. At the same time, composition and formatting can be done using lightweight markdown syntax, and R code and its output can be seamlessly included using knitr. Using rticles requires the prerequisites that will be automatically installed with the latest release of RStudio. Please make sure that you are using latest version of RStudio and update all the packages in your package library. rticles - https://github.com/rstudio/rticles 3.1.1 Installation You can install and use rticles from CRAN as follows: install.packages(&quot;rticles&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) If you wish to install the development version from GitHub you can do this: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/rticles&quot;) 3.1.2 Using rticles from RStudio Install latest RStudio Install the rticles package install.packages(&quot;rticles&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) RStudio::File-New R Markdown-From Template-Elsevier Journal Article 3.1.3 YAML YAML is the preamble found at the top of the .Rmd file. YAML is used to configure front matter of the article and some other important technical parameters of your document. Front matter: title: author: address: abstract: Citations and bibliography: bibliography: file_with_your_citations.bib csl: biomed-central.csl Acceptable bibliography files: mods, bibtex, ris, enl, xml, medline, copac, json. csl defines citation style if other than standard Elsevier format is needed (see https://www.zotero.org/styles for repository of current available styles.). Cross-referencing output: bookdown::pdf_book: base_format: rticles::elsevier_article 3.2 Writing in markdown 3.2.1 Overview Writing in markdown is fairly easy even without prior knowledge of other markup languages. Markdown is a lightweight markup language design so it can be converted to many other formats including LaTex - a format commonly used for typesetting academic typography. Writing in markdown is much more pleasing than writing in LaTex because of the minimal markup. Because of the minimal markup, documents written in markdown can be easily read and edited without code distractions. Furthermore, because markdown documents are written in plain text they can be edited with a plain text editor which are freely available on all major platforms. There are many specially designed editors with additional features that may be more attractive to different groups of developers or writers working with markdown documents. Editors that work great for writing academic style documents include RStudio, Atom, and Sublime Text. 3.2.2 Markdown basics Emphasis *italic* **bold** _italic_ __bold__ Headers # Header 1 ## Header 2 ### Header 3 Lists * Item 1 * Item 2 + Item 2a (note: indent by 4 spaces before +) + Item 2b Images Images on the web or local files in the same directory: ![](http://example.com/logo.png) ![optional caption text](figures/img.png) More on Markdown basics can found on the excellent RStudio website: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html 3.3 LaTex Any LaTex code can be included in the markdown document. LaTex code included in the .Rmd file will be processed (“knitted”) by RStudio’s knitr package and then passed to pandoc document converter. In this process, knitr takes plain text document with markup and code, executes embedded commands, and then compiles results into a separate document which is then passed to pandoc for final conversion. In the workflow relevant to writing academic manuscript using raw .Rmd file, .Rmd file is first converted to .tex and then the resulting .tex file is converted to .pdf. 3.4 Tables 3.4.1 Plain markdown table Adding tables to a manuscript is easy with plain markdown. See an example below of how you can Header 1 | Header 2 ------------- | ------------- Cell 1 | Cell 2 Cell 3 | Cell 4 When creating a table in markdown there is no need to perfectly align all separators. The code above will generate this table: Header 1 Header 2 Cell 1 Cell 2 Cell 3 Cell 4 3.4.2 LaTex tables LaTex tables can be embedded into .Rmd markdown file. LaTex tables can be generated using popular R packages like stargazer or xtable. LaTex tables can be also generated by numerous free online conversion or table generation services (just google it). 3.4.3 R code generated tables To reference a table a table needs to be included in the r chunk with the chunk label. ```{r cars-table} library(&quot;knitr&quot;) kable( head(mtcars[, 1:8], 10), booktabs = TRUE, caption = &#39;A table of the first 10 rows of the mtcars data.&#39; ) ``` In the example above the chunk label is cars-table so to reference this table use prefix tab: plus the chunk label - tab:cars-table. Here is the referencing in action (see Table \\@ref(tab:cars-table)). Using this approach tables will be generated at the end of the manuscript accompanied with an automatic generation of the “List of Tables” (hyperlinks in all locations included). 3.5 Figures Adding figures to your manuscript can be done by inserting pre-generated images or by generating figures right from the embedded R code. It is highly advisable to adapt the latter approach of generating figures from embedded r code to enhance reproducibility of your findings and to minimize common versioning errors (unintended inclusion of earlier or inaccurate version of the figure). 3.5.1 Inserting an image from a file ![caption for my image](path/to/image.jpg) It is possible to include an image from any accessible directory. However, it is advisable to have a /figures or /images folder in your project directory with all the figures or images used for the project. Elsevier template will automatically generate figure caption. If you are using other template to typeset your manuscript then you may need to add fig_caption: yes YAML option to render a caption. 3.5.2 R code generated figures It is advisable to generate figures directly from a code embedded in the manuscript. One of the options to do that would be to include R code for each figure in each separate figure environment (chunk ) at the very end of your manuscript. This way each figure chunk can have reference label and a figure captions (e.g., {r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!'}). Chunk parameters also can be used fine tune apperance of the figure in the manuscritp (e.g., out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'). For example: ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap=&#39;Here is a nice figure!&#39;, out.width=&#39;80%&#39;, fig.asp=.75, fig.align=&#39;center&#39;} par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) ``` Figure can be referenced by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure \\@ref(fig:nice-fig). The following guideline is from https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). 3.5.3 Crossreferensing tips To cross reference figures or tables generated within a code chunk labels within the chunk should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). For example {r nice-fig and not {r nice.fig or {r nice&amp;fig. 3.5.4 Setting aspect ratio of plots The aspect ratio of a figure is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side - the with to height ratio. The golden ratio (1.618) is the ratio that has been appearing in ancient artwork as early as 2,400 BCE and fascinated many ancient mathematicians and artists alike. Edward Tufte suggested that “[g]raphics should tend toward the horizontal” and proposed the use of Golden ratio to create visually appealing figures (Tufte, E. R. 2001). Aspect ratio in R chunk can be set by using fig.asp command. For example, to set a Golden ratio for a figure (1/1.618=0.618) you would type fig.asp=0.618 The chunk option fig.asp can be used to set the aspect ratio of plots, i.e., the ratio of figure height/width. If the figure width is 6 inches (fig.width = 6) and fig.asp = 0.7, the figure height will be automatically calculated from fig.width * fig.asp = 6 * 0.7 = 4.2. The actual size of a plot is determined by the chunk options fig.width and fig.height (the size of the plot generated from a graphical device), and we can specify the output size of plots via the chunk options out.width and out.height. The possible value of these two options depends on the output format of the document. For example, out.width = '30%' is a valid value for HTML output, but not for LaTeX/PDF output. However, knitr will automatically convert a percentage value for out.width of the form x% to (x / 100) \\linewidth, e.g., out.width = '70%' will be treated as .7\\linewidth when the output format is LaTeX. This makes it possible to specify a relative width of a plot in a consistent manner. "],

Git is a free and open source version control system. Git is designed to efficiently handle small and large project whether your are working on PC, Mac, or Linux. Git features make is a versatile companion for any size of the writing project but it especially stands out in its ability to handle complex writing projects like an original research manuscript for example. Git allows and encourages of creation of multiple local or remote branches that can be used for independent development of project features. When branches mature, or when features are fully developed, they can be seamlessly merged into the main branch called master. Thus, new branches can be conceptualized as a sandbox for new feature where user can freely explore a hypothetical scenario of developing this new feature without modifying content of a master branch (context of a main project or a file). This ability to easily create new branches and seamlessly switch between branches facilitates more efficient workflow for writing complex documents like a research manuscript. Although this method requires additional time investment to master this process, it is likely that many researchers will find this investment beneficial in the long term. 4.2 General overview of project structure over time Research manuscripts are an example of 4.3 General overview of team workflow Content coming soon. 4.4 General outline master branch will be used ONLY for submission quality files rough_draft branch will be used ONLY for final draft quality work we will use local branches to develop content for rough_draft stage and merge to rough_draft through pull requests only we will merge to master branch only when we have rough_draft ready for submission we will exclude *.pdf files from git tracking by adding them to .gitignore` file we will exclude images/* directory from git tracking by adding this directory to .gitignore file .gitignore file should be in the main directory with the following exceptions: .Rproj.user .Rhistory .RData .Ruserdata Data-Visualization-Analysis/figures/* *.pdf .Rproj 4.5 Practical appliation to a manuscript development The folowing visual representation of a GitFlow was heavily adapted from: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ GitFlow for development of a Research Manuscript 4.6 Main branches The central repo holds two branches with an infinite lifetime: master (publication ready state) rough-draft (latest delivered development state) When rough-draft branch is reached stable state suitable for submission to a journal, all of the changes are merged into master branch and tagged with a manuscript release number. 4.7 Supporting branches Supporting branches have limited life time and will be removed eventually. Two different types of branches we may use: Feature branches Pre-submission branches 4.7.1 Feature branches Feature branches are used to develop a specific part of the manuscript. These are the branches where the most work is done by the members of the team. These branches are created locally on the machines where these features are being develop and they are merged through Pull requests only into rough-draft branch. These branches are short lived and will follow the following convention: May branch off from: rough-draft Must merge back into: rough-draft Branch naming convention: anything except master, rough draft, pre-submission 4.7.1.1 Creating a feature branch When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the rough-draft branch. $ git checkout -b myfeature rough-draft Switched to a new branch “myfeature”` 4.7.1.2 Incorporating a finished feature on develop Finished features may be merged into the develop branch to definitely add them to the upcoming release: $ git checkout develop Switched to branch ‘develop’ $ git merge –no-ff myfeature Updating ea1b82a..05e9557 (Summary of changes) $ git branch -d myfeature Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557). $ git push origin develop The --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature. In the latter case, it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a feature—you would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true headache in the latter situation, whereas it is easily done if the –no-ff flag was used. Yes, it will create a few more (empty) commit objects, but the gain is much bigger than the cost. 4.7.2 Pre-submission branch May branch off from: rough-draft Must merge back into: master Branch naming convention: pre-submission* This branch is to bring a complete rough draft to a specific publication standard. Various journals will have variuos requirements. This branch will branch of a complete rough-draft and will merge only into master. A submission will be residing in the master branch. 4.7.2.1 Creating pre-submission branch $ git checkout -b presubmission rough-draft Switched to a new branch “presubmission” $ ./bump-version.sh 0.1 Files modified successfully, manuscript version bumped to 0.1. $ git commit -a -m “Bumped manuscript version number to 0.1” [presubmission 41e61bb] Bumped version number to 0.1 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-) Don’t forget to bump the version number after branching off! Then, bring the manuscript to a submission ready state in one or more separate commits. $ git commit -m “Manuscript is brought to submission ready state for sumbmission in …” [presubmission abbe5d6] Manuscript is brought to submission ready state for sumbmission in … 5 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-) 4.7.2.1.1 Finishing presubmission branch When finished, the presubmission branch needs to be merged into master. First, update master and tag the release. $ git checkout master Switched to branch &#39;master&#39; $ git merge –no-ff presubmission Merge made by recursive. (Summary of changes) $ git tag -a 0.1 Finally, remove the temporary presubmission branch: $ git branch -d presubmission Deleted branch presubmission (was abbe5d6). "],
